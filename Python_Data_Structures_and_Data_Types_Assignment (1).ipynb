        "3What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "- The main differences between lists and tuples in Python are that lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable. This means that lists can be changed, while tuples cannot.           \n",

        "LIST:\n",
        "- A list is a collection of various data types, such as integers, floats, strings, objects, or lists. The elements in the list are separated by commas and are stored in the square bracket ([]). Lists are mutable (i.e., elements can be modified after the creation), and ordered (i.e., elements are indexed). The index in the list starts from the first element (index = 0) to the last element (index = number of elements – 1).\n",

        "TUPLES:\n",
        "- Similar to the list, tuples are also the data structure in Python, with the key difference that they are immutable (i.e., elements can’t be modified after creation). In Python, Tuples are widely used where data integrity, order preservation, and immutability are important. The order of the elements in tuples is preserved, which allows for easy access and manipulation using indexes. It can store elements of any data type, including numbers, strings, Boolean, or even another tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "- Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.\n",
        "- A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "- Because sets cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element, it makes sets highly useful to efficiently remove duplicate values from a list or tuple and to perform common math operations like unions and intersections.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is a string in Python and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "- Characters arranged in an unchangeable order. Consider writing a sentence, a paragraph, or a piece of material.\n",
        "-  Operations: Each character in the string can be accessed by its index, or position. Substrings can be extracted using slicing. Strings can be joined together and altered using a   \n",

        "7.How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "- Tuples are immutable to ensure that their contents remain constant throughout their lifecycle, guaranteeing data integrity and reliability.\n",
        "-  This immutability allows tuples to be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets, as they can be hashed.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "- A hash table in Python is a data structure that stores key-value pairs in an array format, using a hash function to create a unique index for each data value.\n",
        "-  Hash tables or has maps in Python are implemented through the built-in dictionary data type. The keys of a dictionary in Python are generated by a hashing function. The elements of a dictionary are not ordered and they can be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "- Yes a list can also contain a mix of Python types including strings, floats, and Boolean.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, strings have the property of immutability which means they cannot be mutated or changed. You can assign strings to variables, and reassign new strings to the same       variable, but individual characters within a string cannot be reassigned.\n",
        "- In Python, strings are made immutable so that programmers cannot alter the contents of the object (even by mistake). This avoids unnecessary bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks4\n",
        "- Dictionarys have two parts to every entry the key and the value and these are stored as pairs.\n",
        "- This can give you more flexibility when storing data. The primary advantage would be retrieving stored values as it is much simpler to search through a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n",
        "- Use a tuple if you need an immutable collection where the elements won't change after creation. Tuples are generally faster and more memory-efficient than lists, making them better for fixed collections, especially as dictionary keys or when iteration speed is crucial.\n",
        "- Tuples are faster than lists. Tuples make the code safe from any accidental modification. If a data is needed in a program which is not supposed to be changed, then it is better to put it in 'tuples' than in 'list'.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "13ans:A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Think of it as a bag where you can throw in items, but each item can exist only once. But if you try to add  a\n",
        "duplicate, python will simply ignore it.\n",
        "       \n",
        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "- The \"in\" and not in operator works on dictionaries; it tells you whether something appears or not as a key in the dictionary. It returns two values True or False.\n",
        "- The in operator uses different algorithms for lists and dictionaries. For lists, it uses a search algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "- No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple in Python because tuples are \"immutable,\" meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed; attempting to do so will result in a TypeError\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "- Nested dictionary is an unordered collection of dictionary. Slicing Nested Dictionary is not possible. We can shrink or grow nested dictionary as need. Like Dictionary, it also has key and value.\n",

        "\n",
        "-  Let us first create a dictionary that contains data items with their corresponding.\n",
        "key value pairs in a python programming language.\n",

        "17.Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n",
        "- The time complexity of accessing an element in a Python dictionary is \\(O(1)\\), which means it's constant time. This is because dictionaries use a hash table internally, which allows for fast lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "- List is ordered, mutable, and allows duplicate values. In a dictionary, the dictionary is unordered and mutable, but the dictionary doesn't allow duplicate values with the same key in it. Lists are used to store the data, which should be ordered and sequential.\n",
        "- If you need an ordered collection, like a sequence of user actions, lists are your go-to. On the other hand, when you need quick look-ups, like mapping usernames to user data, dictionaries are invaluable.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "- A dictionary is termed an unordered collection of objects because dictionaries do not maintain any inherent order of the items based on when they were added. In older versions of Python (before 3.7), dictionaries did not preserve insertion order at all.\n",
        "- Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval?\n",
        "- Data retrieval from a list is based on indices, while data retrieval from a dictionary is based on keys.\n",
